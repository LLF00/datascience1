    "# Bulding a Logistic Regression model in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a type of probabilistic classification model. It works best for a binary output (e.g., predicting whether someone has a disease or not; predicting if a credit card transaction is likely to be fraudulent or not; predicting whether someone is likely to survive the Titanic or not). \n",
    "\n",
    "## The difference between probability and likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability refers to finding the chance that something happens given a sample distribution of data. For example, if we collected income data from 100 people which was normally distributed and had the following characteristics: $$ \\mu = 50,000 $$ and $$ \\sigma = 5 ,000$$ we could calculate the *probability* that someone has a salary greater than $48,000. First we find the z-score: $$ z = {x - \\mu \\over \\sigma} $$ thus $$ z = {48,000 - 50,000 \\over 5,000} $$ which results in $$ z = -0.4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can look up the corresponding z-value in the z-table which equals 0.34458. Now we can calculate the probability that someone makes more than $48,000 by calculating $$P(>48,000) = 1-0.34458 = 0.65542$$ Therefore, there is a 65% chance a randomly selected person makes more than $48,000\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "*Likelihood* flips the question around and essentially tries to figure out the best characteristics (probability distribution) of data given a particular value. For example, if we collected a bunch of income data (let's say 100 observations), and we observed that most of the observations are between $45,000 and $50,000, which distribution (normal, exponential, gamma) with what characteristics (mean, standard deviation) would maximize the likelihood that we observe what we observed? We could check a whole bunch of different distributions (e.g., normal distribution with mean of $30,000 and stdev of $2,000, OR normal distribution with mean of $48,000 and stdev of $3,000, and so on) and how they fit the data, and we would pick the distribution and characteristics which maximize the likelihood that we see what we saw in our data (i.e., if our collected data had an average income of $48,000, we would pick the distribution which has this average as well). Basically, we are trying to find the best distribution as opposed to already having the distribution available. Once we find the best distribution, we can calculate probabilities!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, a common modelling problem is the question of estimating a joint probability distribution for a dataset. Density estimation would involve selecting a probability distribution function and the parameters that best explain the joint probability of observed data, so the obvious questions are: How should you choose the distribution function? How should you choose the parameters for the probability density function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common techniques are Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). MLE assumes that all solutions are equally likely, while MAP takes into account prior information about the form of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLE treats the problem as an optimization problem (i.e., searching for the optimal solution). We wish to maximize the probability of observing the data from a joint probability distribution given a distribution and parameters that we already know. Mathematically this is stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X | \\theta)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where theta is an unknown parameter. The resulting conditional probability is referred to as the *likelihood* of observing the data given the model parameters and uses the notation: \n",
    "$$L(X | \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating conditional probabilities, gven a sample comprises of n-examples, this can be framed as the joint probabilty of the observed data samples (x1, x2...xn) given the probability distribution parameters. The joint probability distribution can be restated as the multiplication of the conditional probability of observing each example, given the distribution parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying all the small probabilities, however, is time consuming, so we can restate this further as the sum of the log conditional probabilities of observing each example given the model parameters. This is what leads to the use of the term *log-likelihood function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are *fitting* a machine learning model, we are essentially trying to estimate probability density - i.e., finding the best parameters or settings that explain the data. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) framework is used for density estimation in both supervised and unsupervised models (and in neural nets) - it provides the basis for both Linear and Logistic Regression models. In summary, you can think of it as an optimization problem of searching a whole bunch of parameters in order to find the BEST parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The good stuff - Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the slides to supplement your learning but this will be more detailed and probably better. Yes, you can use this for the exam. Yes, the exam will include content from this notebook (I guess you would only know that if you read this far already!!). Don't worry; I'll remind you to read it in class. Anyway, I digress...\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed, logistic regression is used *primarily* for predicting binary classes (True/False, 0/1, Yes/No type of problems). Just like linear regression, logistic regression will have a function in the form of:\n",
    "$$ y = mx + b$$\n",
    "Where the coefficients will tell us information about how the input variables (x-values) impact our output variable (probability of Y / 1 / True). The main difference between logistic and linear regression, is that logistic regression will produce an output that is always between 0 and 1 (0 = 0% likelihood of an outcome happening; 1=100% likelihood of an outcome happening). This translates to the 0/1 binary outcome using a probability threshold - the default threshold is 50%, meaning that if the probability of an outcome is 50% or higher, it's classified as 1 (i.e., if the probability of a credit card transaction being fraudulent is calculated as 55%, it would be classified as a 1 or Yes or True).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate probabilities, we use the Sigmoid function (also called logistic function):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S(x) = {1 \\over 1+e^{-x}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is interpreted as a probability from a Binomial probability distribution function for the class labeled 0 or 1. In general when we produce the function which corresponds with the model, we are estimating the coefficients / parameters from the sample of observations that we have - in theory, these samples are representative of the population. We must always remember there will be 'noise' in the data, which is what we typically consider the errors. For logistic regression, we look at MLE to estimate parameters (if you remember, for Linear regression we discussed Least Squares Optimization - this is similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odds and log-odds\n",
    "\n",
    "Odds, if you read the slides, are often stated as wins or losses. For example, what are the odds of me drawing a Jack of Hearts from a deck of cards? We can convert the probabilility produced by the logistic regression model to \"odds of success\", defined as the probability of success divided by the probability of not success:\n",
    "$$ odds = {p \\over (1-p)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm is calculated as the log of the odds (hence, log-istic regression!):\n",
    "$$log odds = {log{p\\over (1-p)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick review here on logs -- generally with log calculations we are trying to calculate an exponent which yields a value. For example \n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_28 = 3$$ \n",
    "because \n",
    "$$2^3 = 8$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are not provided a log base, we assume we're using e as the base, and e = 2.71\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we put it all together (and if you remember my drawings on the board in class); we use the logit function (above) to project odds on a scale of -infinity to + infinity - this allows to project data onto a straight line (this is the blue line in the picture on Slide 10 of the notes). This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = mx + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then optimize the coefficients of this straight line, using gradient descent for example (more on this in a later class... maybe next semester). Then, we use the sigmoid function to convert the -infinity to +infinity values BACK to a probability of 0-1, so we can actually classify our outputs. In sum, the objective of our model is to predict/output a probability of belonging to class 1 or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, you won't have to do this by hand - but it's important to understand the logic/math behind all of the models we are learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Coding Part\n",
